Duml produces [PlantUML](http://plantuml.com/) descriptors based upon classes from D.

You can disable Object classes being displayed by adding the version DumlIgnoreObject.

__Things I'd like to have implemented:__
- Attributes of methods (failed to figure out how to do so nicely so won't do right now)
- Notes

__Example images:__
