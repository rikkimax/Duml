Duml produces [PlantUML](http://plantuml.com/) descriptors based upon classes from D.

You can disable Object classes being displayed by adding the version DumlIgnoreObject.

__Things I'd like to have implemented:__
- Alias this displaying
- Structs and unions
- shared/inout/const/immutable support
